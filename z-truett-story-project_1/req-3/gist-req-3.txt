# 3. sidebar for amp-story-player

## From initial requirements document

> When upgrading the CSS template, one of our requirements is to implement a table-of-contents in a sidebar.
An earlier Google amp-story version supported a sidebar.
However, the current release deprecates a sidebar in amp-story and "moves it" to amp-story-player using JavaScript.
In effect, amp-story-player is an iframe for an external instances of an amp-story.
The sidebar is part of the iframe and enables navigation within the instance of an amp-story.

Here is the Google sidebar guidance example:

# Status:
* Complete (well done)

# Next steps:
* Update preliminary sidebar CSS to standardize Truett CSS, fonts and colors
