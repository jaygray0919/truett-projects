Let me know how i can improve this or clarify

from the file
	__items-workbook_-_21-12-09.xlsx

copy out
	row 11, cells BR thru BCE

that file is attached as
	_vlad-row-11-raw.txt

next, remove all tabs from the file (\t)
there are 1365 occurences

next remove all pipes (|)
there are 384 occurences

next replace ^ with a space
there are 6 occurences

i performed the above and saved the file as
	_vlad-row-11-clean.html

you can run that file locally in your browser
it is identical to your original source file
	1_1.svg

--------------------
let's do another one

copy out
	row 18, cells BR thru BCE

it is attached as
	_vlad-row-18-raw.txt

repeat above
	delete \t
	delete |
	change ^ to space

as implemented here
	_vlad-row-18-clean.html

compare that to your original
	4_2.svg

there is an error; the white medalion is missing!
this is my mistake - not yours
i can quickly fix this
but i would prefer that you do the error checking so that you become comfortable with the above process

-----
ask me questions about anything above that is not clear
