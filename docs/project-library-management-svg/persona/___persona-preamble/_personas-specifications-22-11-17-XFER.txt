Audience
========

Arguably the most important issue for these types of projects is answering the question:
	who is the audience?

We don't want to just "make up" labels; we want to use Structured Data to define our audience.
The principle reason:
	our content is part of Google search results

The idea for Rice, Wheat and similar presentations is to feature a Persona on a page to identify an instance of our audience.
Wikipedia defines a Persona as:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona

There are three parts to a Persona

1. Ontologies needed to define a Persona
Here are core ontologies
	http://wiki.eclipse.org/Persona_Data_Model_2.0

2. Definition of roles and responsibilities (Roles)

In the US Department of Labor (US DOL) Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS occupations
	https://www.bls.gov/ocs/ocsjobde.htm
	https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ocs/data.htm

In Europe, O*NET
	https://www.onetonline.org/

For example, here is astronomer
	https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes192011.htm

Here is food scientist on BLS SOC
	https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes191012.htm

Here is Food Scientists and Technologists on O*NET
	https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/19-1012.00

Here are several roles in the audience that are interested in our work:
	https://afdsi.com/___supplier/paula-perez/schema-audience/data.txt
The ontology we use is
	schema.org (from Google, Microsoft, et al)
You can see where we declare the target ontology in this statement
	"@context":"http://schema.org/"
The next declaration:
	"@type":"BusinessAudience"
The text that we use comes from US DOL BLS SOC and O*NET

Here, Google reads and "understands" our audience declarations
	https://validator.schema.org/#url=https%3A%2F%2Fafdsi.com%2F_talent%2Fpaula%2Fschema-audience%2Fdata.txt

Let's look at a more complex declaration: Food Scientists and Technologists

Here is Food Scientists and Technologists in machine-readable format
	https://afdsi.com/_talent/paula/schema-food-scientist/data.txt
which is read and "understood" by Google
	https://validator.schema.org/#url=https%3A%2F%2Fafdsi.com%2F_talent%2Fpaula%2Fschema-food-scientist%2Fdata.txt

Click the box Audience to see how Google parsed the machine-readable data
	then look at Class

3. An image of the Persona

The idea is that the image is a reasonable representation of the person who performs the role; a generic person in an occupation.
We use characterists like gender, garments, hair style (head, facial) and accessories to represent the Persona
