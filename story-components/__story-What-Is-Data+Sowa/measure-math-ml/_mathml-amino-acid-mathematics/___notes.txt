Definition:
One of nine essential amino acids in humans (provided by food), Leucine is important for protein synthesis and many metabolic functions.
Leucine contributes to regulation of blood-sugar levels; growth and repair of muscle and bone tissue; growth hormone production; and wound healing.
Leucine also prevents breakdown of muscle proteins after trauma or severe stress and may be beneficial for individuals with phenylketonuria.
Leucine is available in many foods and deficiency is rare.

Leucine Measurement
C122133
Definition:
The determination of the amount of leucine present in a sample.

lysine
C29171
Definition:
One of nine essential amino acids in humans required for growth and tissue repair, Lysine is supplied by many foods, especially red meats, fish, and dairy products.
Lysine seems to be active against herpes simplex viruses and present in many forms of diet supplements.
The mechanism underlying this effect is based on the viral need for amino acid arginine; lysine competes with arginine for absorption and entry into cells.
Lysine inhibits HSV growth by knocking out arginine. (NCI04)

C122134


methionine
C29600
Definition:
One of nine essential amino acids in humans (provided by food), Methionine is required for growth and tissue repair.
A sulphur-containing amino acid, methionine improves the tone and pliability of skin, hair, and strengthens nails.
Involved in many detoxifying processes, sulphur provided by methionine protects cells from pollutants, slows cell aging, and is essential for absorption and bio-availability of selenium and zinc.
Methionine chelates heavy metals, such as lead and mercury, aiding their excretion.
It also acts as a lipotropic agent and prevents excess fat buildup in the liver. (NCI04)

phenylalanine
C29601
Definition:
An essential aromatic amino acid in humans (provided by food), Phenylalanine plays a key role in the biosynthesis of other amino acids and is important in the structure and function of many proteins and enzymes.
Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine, used in the biosynthesis of dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters.
The L-form of Phenylalanine is incorporated into proteins, while the D-form acts as a painkiller.
Absorption of ultraviolet radiation by Phenylalanine is used to quantify protein amounts. (NCI04)

C81280

threonine
C29602
Definition:
An essential amino acid in humans (provided by food), Threonine is an important residue of many proteins, such as tooth enamel, collagen, and elastin.
An important amino acid for the nervous system, threonine also plays an important role in porphyrin and fat metabolism and prevents fat buildup in the liver.
Useful with intestinal disorders and indigestion, threonine has also been used to alleviate anxiety and mild depression. (NCI04)

tryptophan
C29603
Definition:
The least plentiful of all 22 amino acids and an essential amino acid in humans (provided by food), Tryptophan is found in most proteins and a precursor of serotonin.
Tryptophan is converted to 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP), converted in turn to serotonin, a neurotransmitter essential in regulating appetite, sleep, mood, and pain.
Tryptophan is a natural sedative and present in dairy products, meats, brown rice, fish, and soybeans. (NCI04)

valine
C29604
Definition:
An aliphatic and extremely hydrophobic essential amino acid in humans related to leucine, Valine is found in many proteins, mostly in the interior of globular proteins helping to determine three-dimensional structure.
A glycogenic amino acid, valine maintains mental vigor, muscle coordination, and emotional calm.
Valine is obtained from soy, cheese, fish, meats and vegetables.
Valine supplements are used for muscle growth, tissue repair, and energy. (NCI04)
