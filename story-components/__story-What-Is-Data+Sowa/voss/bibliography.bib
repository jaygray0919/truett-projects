@phdthesis{Fielding2000,
  abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a critical review of patterns and pattern languages in human computer interaction (HCI). In recent years, patterns and pattern languages have received considerable attention in HCI for their potential as a means for developing and communicating information and knowledge to support good design. This review examines the background to patterns and pattern languages in HCI, and seeks to locate pattern languages in relation to other approaches to interaction design. The review explores four key issues: what is a pattern? what is a pattern language? how are patterns and pattern languages used? and how are values reflected in the pattern-based approaches
to design? Following on from the review, a future research agenda is proposed for patterns and pattern languages in HCI.},

@book{Parr2010,
  abstract = {Knowing how to create domain-specific languages (DSLs) can give you a huge productivity boost. Instead of writing code in a general-purpose programming language, you can first build a custom language tailored to make you efficient in a particular domain. The key is understanding the common patterns found across language implementations. Language Implementation Patterns identifies and condenses the most common design patterns, providing sample implementations of each. The pattern implementations use Java, but the patterns themselves are completely general. Some of the implementations use the well-known ANTLR parser generator, so readers will find this book an excellent source of ANTLR examples as well. But this book will benefit anyone interested in implementing languages, regardless of their tool of choice. Other language implementation books focus on compilers, which you rarely need in your daily life. Instead, Language Design Patterns shows you patterns you can use for all kinds of language applications. You’ll learn to create configuration file readers, data readers, model-driven code generators, source-to-source translators, source analyzers, and interpreters. Each chapter groups related design patterns and, in each pattern, you’ll get hands-on experience by building a complete sample implementation. By the time you finish the book, you’ll know how to solve most common language implementation problems.},

Publishing such descriptions on the Web creates the Semantic Web. URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are very important, providing both the core of the framework itself and the link between RDF and the Web. This document presents guidelines for their effective use. It discusses two strategies, called 303 URIs and hash URIs. It gives pointers to several Web sites that use these solutions, and briefly discusses why several other proposals have problems. },

This rapid decline is surprising. How can a technology that was produced by the world's largest software consortium fall from grace so quickly? Many of the reasons are technical: poor architecture, complex APIs, and lack of essential features all contributed to CORBA's downfall. However, such technical shortcomings are a symptom rather than a cause. Ultimately, CORBA failed because its standardization process virtually guarantees poor technical quality. Seeing that other standards consortia use a process that is very similar, this does not bode well for the viability of other technologies produced in this fashion.},

Students were asked to interpret graphs, select an appropriate graph type to represent a relationship and to generate graphs. Accuracy levels varied substantially across the three tasks and three graph types. Theoverall pattern of results is largely explained by the varying ease of transfer of student knowledge from a simpler graph type, based on surface similarity.},

@article{Mai2001,
  abstract = {This paper explains at least some of the major problems related to the subject indexing process and proposes a new approach to understanding the process, which is ordinarily described as a process that takes a number of steps. The subject is rst determined, then it is described in a few sentences and, lastly, the description of the subject is converted into the indexing language. It is argued that this typical approach characteristically lacks an understanding of what the central nature of the process is. Indexing is not a neutral and objective representation of a document’s subject matter but the representation of an interpretation of a document for future use. Semiotics is offered here as a framework for understanding the ‘interpretative’ nature of the subject indexing process. By placing this process within Peirce’s semiotic framework of ideas and terminology, a more detailed description of the process is offered which shows that the uncertainty generally associated with this process is created by the fact that the indexer goes through a number of steps and creates the subject matter of the document during this process. The creation of the subject matter is based on the indexer’s social and cultural context. The paper offers an explanation of what occurs in the indexing process and suggests that there is only little certainty to its result.

  abstract = {Semiotics studies systems of signs. It regards all sign systems as the product of a single human faculty for creating order. The distinction it provides, of signifier, sign and signified, can give a more sophisticated and incisive way of differentiating aspects of the sign than can be derived from any other known source. Information science would seem to have some unnoticed affinities with semiotics in its concerns with the retrieval and transmission of material products of the semiotic faculty and with meaning to concept relations. The alignment of information science with the physical sciences and technology has been criticised and its disciplinary identity questioned. Information science would seem to derive what identity it has from a widely shared concern with computer based retrieval of documentary information. However, a unifying principle for the document and the computer has not been enunciated. For semiotics, written language, and computer programs can be comprehended within the analytical category of the signifier. Automata theory regards the computer as a universal information machine and replaces ideas of energy and motion by logical operations. At the level of discourse of logical operations, there is no distinction between a written expression, or program, and the particular information machine specified by that written expression. Elements in linguistics, not registered in the literature of information science, have departed from the received position that written language is simply a representation of speech and have preferred to regard it as an autonomous system of signs. A specific unifying principle for the document and the computer is then the presence of writing. Revealing such a unifying principle indicates that semiotics can clarify significant issues within the established domains of information science.},

  abstract = {Traditional information behavior studies in library and information science (LIS) research have focused on primarily two trends: one is to provide physical access to material objects and the other is to direct users to certain thoughts and ideas. Both focuses are two sides of the same problem that LIS researchers have worked to address: how to provide a better system or service to accommodate people’s need for information. Among the domains of users, material objects, and meaningful ideas, applying the concept of information as sign with semiotics not only joins these two trends in the analysis of the pragmatic-syntactic relationship and the pragmatic-semantic relationship, but it also gives an additional focus on the syntactic-semantic relationship. It is this additional focus that helps LIS professionals/researchers understand an individual’s states of knowing and ways of obtaining knowledge through physical and mental interactions with informative objects. The author conducts a review of information studies, the epistemological concerns and pragmatic traditions in LIS, and semiotics in an attempt to seek a holistic principle that will incorporate both the traditional trends of LIS research and provide an additional awareness in assisting users to make connections between material objects and ideas in information behavior studies. By applying a semiotic view of information and the concept of information as sign, LIS researchers of information behavior will find semiotics a useful epistemological framework.},

@article{Liskov1974,
  abstract = {The motivation behind the work in very-high-level languages is to ease the programming task by providing the programmer with a language containing primitives or abstractions suitable to his problem area. The programmer is then able to spend his effort in the right place; he concentrates on solving his problem, and the resulting program will be more reliable as a result. Clearly, this is a worthwhile goal. Unfortunately, it is very difficult for a designer to select in advance all the abstractions which the users of his language might need. If a language is to be used at all, it is likely to be used to solve problems which its designer did not envision, and for which the abstractions embedded in the language are not sufficient. This paper presents an approach which allows the set of built-in abstractions to be augmented when the need for a new data abstraction is discovered. This approach to the handling of abstraction is an outgrowth of work on designing a language for structured programming. Relevant aspects of this language are described, and examples of the use and definitions of abstractions are given.},

These developments suggest that similar to other core areas of application design, XML should be designed conceptually before the implementation tasks of designing markup and writing schemas are approached. In this paper, we describe why conceptual modeling will become an important part of the XML landscape, what issues need to be addressed, and what the requirements for a conceptual modeling language for XML are.},

@phdthesis{Necasky2008,
  abstract = {XML is a popular format for data representation. As the amount of data represented in XML grows, it is necessary to concentrate on the process of modeling XML schemes of the XML representations. However, modeling the XML schemes on the level of XML schema languages, such as XML Schema, has some drawbacks. A natural idea to improve this situation is to model the XML schemes first on the conceptual level. It is motivated by the world of relational databases where we also start modeling the data first on the conceptual level.

In this thesis we focus on conceptual modeling for XML. We start with a motivating example to point out to several problems that can arise when using only XML schema languages for modeling XML schemes. We discuss how modeling the data first on the conceptual level can help. We also show that conceptual modeling for XML has some specifics that should be taken into account by a conceptual model for XML. Mainly, we show that it is necessary to separate the conceptual modeling process to two parts. First, we need to model the data independently of its representation in XML. Second, we need to model how the data is represented in different types of XML documents. In the next step, we analyze in detail existing approaches to conceptual modeling for XML and show their limitations. In the main part of the thesis, we introduce our own conceptual model for XML called XSEM that extends the Entity-Relationship model and takes into account the specifics identified in the previous parts of the thesis. The required separation of the conceptual modeling process is supported by two subparts of XSEM called XSEM-ER and XSEM-H. We describe XSEM in a formal way and support the description with examples. Further, we describe in detail how to translate conceptual schemes in XSEM to a representation in the XML Schema language. We conclude with possible applications of the proposed model and our current and future work in the area.},

  abstract = {The process of conceptual design is independent of the final platform and the medium of implementation, and is usually in a form that is understandable and usable by managers and other personnel who may not be familiar with the low-level implementation details, but have a major influence in the development process. Although a strong design phase is involved in most current application development processes (e.g., Entity Relationship design for relational databases), conceptual design for XML has not been explored significantly in literature or in practice. Most XML design processes start by directly marking up data in XML, and the metadata is typically designed at the time of encoding the documents. In this chapter, the reader is introduced to existing methodologies for modeling XML. A discussion is then presented comparing and contrasting their capabilities and deficiencies, and delineating the future trend in conceptual design for XML applications.},

The Web Ontology Language (OWL) from W3C is an expressive formalism for modelers to define various logical concepts and relations. OWL ontologies come in three species: Lite, DL, and Full, ordered in increasing expressivity. Every Lite ontology is also a DL ontology, and every DL ontology is also a Full ontology. OWL Lite and OWL DL are the species that use only the OWL language features in the way that complete and sound reasoning procedures exist. OWL Full, on the other hand, is undecidable. While OWL recently became a W3C recommendation in 2004, people have been working with it a few years, and
many interesting ontologies already exist on the Web. We are interested in evaluating these ontologies and see if there are interesting trends in modeling practices, OWL construct usages, and OWL species utilization.},

@incollection{Schmicking2009,
  abstract = {In addition to a large number of misrepresentations of phenomenology,1 one can see an increasing interest in phenomenology among cognitive scientists and analytic philosophers. It is the method of phenomenology from which one expects to shed some light on the problem of consciousness. How does this approach work? What are the specific tools of phenomenology? Explanations as well as critical discussions of phenomenological methods are scattered across the literature. Moreover, the sometimes misleading or impenetrable terminology of classical phenomenology blocks easy understanding. The language of phenomenology may be an important reason why the working cognitive scientist who may be ready to delve into the primary sources of phenomenology might be discouraged, puzzled or disappointed by the notorious difficulty of many of the classical phenomenological authors.2 Thus the main goal of this essay is to offer a sketch of the methods of phenomenology, which appeals to outsiders of phenomenology, and, hopefully, to a few insiders too, if it can provide a (not quite) new way of looking at some (not quite) old ideas. After a short remark on the general character of phenomenology (Part II), phenomenological methods will be presented as a series of steps (Part III) and as a toolbox (Part IV). A concluding remark relates the offered account of method to the issue of the naturalization of phenomenology (Part V).},

The algorithm reduces construction of the parsing table to computing multiple products of Boolean matrices of various size. Its time complexity on an input string of length n is O(BMM(n) log n), where BMM(n) is the number of operations needed to multiply two Boolean matrices of size n × n, which is O(n2.376) as per the current knowledge},

The implications of such a view of programming on matters such as program life and modification, system development methods, and the professional status of programmers, are discussed.},

This is pursued along three dimensions that are seen as inherently connected: the epistemological dimension of reality construction; the communal dimension of dialogical closure; and the ethical dimension of autonomy and dialogical responsibility. In order to exemplify his style of working as a mentor, Heinz von Foerster is portrayed in interaction, drawing largely on the author's experience. As one concrete case of a far-reaching general approach, the paper brings out the implications of his way of thinking for cooperative software design. This leads to an epistemological view of the design process, to guidelines for communal work focussing on dialogue and self-organization, and to the ethics of systems design, which means taking responsibility for the choices made in design and the choice scopes associated with computer-based systems.},

  abstract = {The recent resurgence of interest in design science as meta-theoretical framework for information systems research is taken as a motivation for the re-appraisal of Peter Naur’s notion of “programming as theory building”. In stark contrast to the artifact orientation of current design science frameworks, Naur considers the artifact orientation as one of the most fundamental misconception in the information systems discipline (in its widest sense). Naur’s work is philosophically challenging since it has not only meta-theoretical relevance, e.g., as an opposition to design science frameworks, but also practical relevance, e.g., for the conduct and management of information systems development—thus bridging the traditional theory–practice gap. Moreover, Naur’s work not only exhibits the tension between relevance and rigor in information systems research but also illustrates that rigorous and relevant research may still yield questionable results. The goal of the paper is to direct the interested reader’s attention to a view on information systems development that challenges a number of presuppositions not only of the meta-theoretical design science frameworks in contemporary information systems research but of other meta-theoretical frameworks as well. It might thus serve the reader as a starting point for a critical reflection on metatheoretical presuppositions underlying her/his understanding of information systems development.},

This paper starts from the premise that this lack of research is due to the inherent complexity of databases that are not fully understood in a forensic context yet. The paper considers the relevant differences between file systems and databases and then transfers concepts of File System Forensics to Database Forensics. It is found that databases are inherently multidimensional from a forensic perspective. A notation is introduced to express the meaning of various possible forensic queries within this multidimensional context. It is posited that this notation, with the multidimensional nature of databases as described, forms a map for possible Database Forensics research projects.},

However, there is neither an established framework nor common terminology for investigating data quality. There is not even agreement on what the term “data” means. We lay a foundation for the study of data quality in this paper. In the first part of the paper we discuss five approaches to defining “data” in the literature. We then propose an approach especially conducive to discussing data quality. In the second part of the paper we discuss the most important dimensions of data quality: accuracy, completeness, consistency and currentness. We define these four and several related dimensions and discuss them in detail. We close the paper by outlining several areas for further research on data quality.},

@article{Rosenthal2010,
  abstract = {For years, discussions of digital preservation have routinely featured comments such as “bit preservation is a solved problem; the real issues are ...”. Indeed, current digital storage technologies are not just astoundingly cheap and capacious, they are astonishingly reliable. Unfortunately, these attributes drive a kind of “Parkinson’s Law” of storage, in which demands continually push beyond the capabilities of systems implementable at an affordable price. This paper is in four parts:

Claims, reviewing a typical claim of storage system reliability, showing that it provides no useful information for bit preservation purposes.

Theory, proposing “bit half-life” as an initial, if inadequate, measure of bit preservation performance, expressing bit preservation requirements in terms of it, and showing that the requirements being placed on bit preservation systems are so onerous that the experiments required to prove that a solution exists are not feasible.

Practice, reviewing recent research into how well actual storage systems preserve bits, showing that they fail to meet the requirements by many orders of magnitude.

Policy, suggesting ways of dealing with this unfortunate situation. },

@techreport{Bagley1968,
  abstract = {The aim of the study is to find ways of designing new programming languages which have increased flexibility without also having increased complexity. The work is based on the idea that it is possible to design a language which is truly independent of the hardware characteristics of current computers. A new technique of expressing data values, data elements, and data structures has been developed. The technique provides for the construction of arbitrarily-complex data elements, and for arbitrarily-chosen relationships between data elements. All expressions in a program which cause the language processor to take some action, which includes 'declarations', are viewed as transformations ('procedures'). A basic set of these transformations has been proposed. The most significant demand on machine design which arises from this research is that much more freedom of storage organization is needed than is provided by conventional machines. Large-scale associative memories could be used to provide some of this needed flexibility of storage. Recommendations for further work are presented and an extensive bibliography on programming language, concepts, and design is appended. },

@article{Eriksson2010,
  abstract = {Identifiers — such as personal identification numbers, student numbers, and license numbers — are used for identifying individual objects and constitute an important part of the information infrastructures of organizations and society. The design, choice, assignment, withdrawal, and replacement of identifiers are significant economic and political issues with more profound consequences than are perhaps commonly perceived. Use of identifiers can result in significant costs because they may include descriptive information, because an inappropriate identifier may be chosen for the object in question, or because there may be a lack of institutional control of the identifier. The objective of this paper is to elaborate on these problems by explaining the identifier construct from a technical, institutional, ontological, and information infrastructural perspective. Based on this understanding, we provide guidelines for how identifiers should be designed, chosen, replaced, and controlled. Accordingly, we address the practical need for improved design principles relating to the increasingly important infrastructural character of computerized information systems that stems from the importance of appropriate identifiers for information infrastructures and society as a whole. In order to understand the role, function, and meaning of identifiers, it is important to acknowledge that the identifier is fundamentally a linguistic construct used when referring to socially constructed institutional objects. Institutional objects are symbolic entities that represent institutional and brute facts, which are the results of human actions.},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate several concepts that are known in database research for some time but which are still surrounded by some confusion. We start with the concepts of object identifier, surrogate and key and list the differences between these concepts, which in practice are often ignored. Sharpening these differences allows us to analyze the distinction between objects and roles that recently surfaced in the literature. Distinguishing objects from roles helps to avoid migration of objects between classes and thus the problems associated with it. We show that this distinction requires the use of role identifiers that, just as object identifiers, should be globally unique and unchangeable. We next show that using role identifiers requires a distinction between two essentially different kinds of inheritance relationships, is-a inheritance and played-by inheritance. These are often both treated as if they were one and the same kind of is-a relationship. The result of the discussio...},

  abstract = {Identifying and labeling things is what we all do every day; it is how we communicate about the things in the world around us, e.g. “please pass the salt” or “my ticket is for seat D3”. Identifying things and assigning identifiers to them is also a fundamental part of working in the digital realm. We need to identify resources, concepts, agents, relationships, mappings, properties, namespaces, schemas, profiles, etc. Many of these have confusing subtleties of meaning, so it may help to deconstruct the identification processes we perform intuitively so we can reconstruct a sensible approach to designing our identifiers. This paper looks at how we identify things by comparing the sameness of their characteristics, how we associate symbols with things to simplify identifying them, and concludes there are six aspects that make up an identifier: a thing, a symbol, an association, a context, an agent, and a remembrance. It then considers some of the qualities of identifiers in more detail: scope, uniqueness, granularity, intelligence, actionability, persistence, extensibility, and context. It finally provides a simple checklist for designing identifiers.},

  abstract = {{Readers of programs have two main sources of domain information: identifier names and comments. When functions are uncommented, as many are, comprehension is almost exclusively dependent on the identifier names. Assuming that writers of programs want to create quality identifiers (e.g., include relevant domain knowledge) how should they go about it? For example, do the initials of a concept name provide enough information to represent the concept? If not, and a longer identifier is needed, is an abbreviation satisfactory or does the concept need to be captured in an identifier that includes full words? Results from a study designed to investigate these questions are reported. The study involved over 100 programmers who were asked to describe twelve different functions. The functions used three different "levels" of identifiers: single letters, abbreviations, and full words. Responses allow the level of comprehension associated with the different levels to be studied. The functions include standard algorithms studied in computer science courses as well as functions extracted from production code. The results show that full word identifiers lead to the best comprehension; however, in many cases, there is no statistical difference between full words and abbreviations.}},

@incollection{Buckland1998b,
  abstract = {Why were technical and technological experimentation and innovation, notably but not only by the European documentalists, substantially ignored in library science in the U.S.A. until after the Second World War? What would explain the intense but generally unsatisfactory controversy involving "information science versus library science" after the Second War World? Why was technical and technological innovation a vital force in librarianship in the late nineteenth century and in late twentieth century, but not, it seems, inbetween?
Analysis suggests that these three issues are closely related. One reason design and technology were of limited interest within library science in the U.S.A. in the second quarter of this century is that the most influential academic group was engaged in a vigorous, well-funded drive to develop a new school of thought with a new and different emphasis. By the 1930s the Graduate Library School at the University of Chicago and the European documentalists represented different schools of thought with different interests. Such differences are to be expected in any field that is alive.
The period after the Second World War was tension-filled, we suggest, because the dominant non-technological, social science oriented paradigm in U.S. library science, what we might call the school of Chicago, was challenged, rivalled, and changed by the return, in part from outside of library science, of a serious interest in design and technology. The matters that had interested the European documentalists emerged as a powerful force in U.S. library science twenty years later than in Europe. There were by now new and more powerful machines. There was, after a few years, a new name: "information science". The individuals leading the change commonly come from outside of librarianship and there was little association with war-devasted Europe. The European documentalists of the 1930s, who had written mainly in French and German, were largely forgotten.
We suggest that the temporary de-emphasis of design and technology contributed to a prolonged failure of identity and direction in the academic departments of library and information studies. What can be the purpose of a university-based professional school if research is not centered on the design of improved services? The absence of this central concern leads to a lack of purpose beyond sustaining a continuity of training in procedures, a preoccupation with "professionalism", and little convincing basis for a research agenda. Absent a central concern with design and technique, a coherent vision for research and for university-based professional education is also absent.},

This representation generally provides smaller encoding sizes and faster processing than a W3C XML representation.

These techniques include the use of dynamic tables (for both character strings and qualified names), initial vocabularies and external vocabularies.

  abstract = {Internet technical specifications often need to define a formal syntax. Over the years, a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular among many Internet specifications. The current specification documents ABNF. It balances compactness and simplicity with reasonable representational power. The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve naming rules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and value ranges. This specification also supplies additional rule definitions and encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type common to several Internet specifications.},

  abstract = {The population of programming languages is steadily growing, and there is no end of this growth in sight. Many language definitions appear in journals, many are found in technical reports, and perhaps an even greater number remains confined to proprietory circles. After frequent exposure to these definitions, one cannot fail to notice the lack of “common denominators.” The only widely accepted fact is that the language structure is defined by a syntax. But even notation for syntactic description eludes any commonly agreed standard form, although the underlying ancestor is invariably the Backus-Naur Form of the Algol 60 report. As variations are often only slight, they become annoying for their very lack of an apparent motivation.},

By using this concept, a new (“fourth”) normal form for relation schemata is defined. This fourth normal form is strictly stronger than Codd's “improved third normal form” (or “Boyce-Codd normal form”). It is shown that every relation schema can be decomposed into a family of relation schemata in fourth normal form without loss of information (that is, the original relation can be obtained from the new relations by taking joins).},

  abstract = {Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.},

  abstract = {It is assumed without proof that diagrams are superior to text for communication.  Diagrams are critical for IS development.  People are not trained on how to draw good diagrams, how to layout and present diagrams.  Some commonly accepted best practices actually hurt readability.  No theoretical or empirical evidence for the syntax used in diagrams.  We need to understand (1) the langauge of graphics and (2) human graphical information processing. 1.  Bertin introduces visual variables: planar (vertical and horizontal placement) and retinal variables (shape, color, size, value, orientation, and texture).  2. Human graphical inofrmation processing involves perceptual processing (discrimination, configuration) and cognitive processing (working memory and long term memory).  Principles for producing effective diagrams can be defined.  1. Discriminability:  Absolute (size, contrast, proximity) and relative. 2. Modularity: most diagrams are too complex to understand.  3. Emphasis: most important things should stand out.  4. Cognitive integration:  most systems represented by many diagrams.  Perceptual integration:  cues for navigation, and conceptual integration: forming a coherent mental representation.  Techniques for cognitive integration: summary diagrams, nagivational map, signmposting, current context.  5.  Perceptual directness: offload interpretation, iconic representations, perceptually direct relationships.  6. Structure: perceptual grouping.  7. Identification: external identification: correspondence between the model and the world; internal identification(graphical encoding) correspondence between conventions and meaning.  8. Visual expressiveness: the number of visual variables used to encode information.  9. Graphical simplicity:  the number of conventions used.  These principles can be applied to graphical languages or to instance models.  They help to design better languages and to modify existing languages.},

For example, it does not really matter if cardinality is shown with a 'crow's foot' or with the symbol '1..*'. This paper argues that such an assumption is wrong and that the notation is extremely important in the process of modelling relationships because of the normative language that the notation specifies. Normative language is shown to be a useful way of understanding and comparing relationship notation. Barker's practical relationship definition, using a formal notation, is shown to be sufficiently well formed to allow the modeller to make sense of the domain in their own linguistic context. Less formal notations are shown to disadvantage the less experienced modeller},

Along with a general rise of user generated content there are more and more tagging systems that allow users to annotate digital resources with tags (keywords) and share their annotations with other users. Tagging is frequently seen in contrast to traditional knowledge organization systems or as something completely new. This paper shows that tagging should better be seen as a popular form of manual indexing on the Web. Difference between controlled and free indexing blurs with sufficient feedback mechanisms. A revised typology of tagging systems is presented that includes different user roles and knowledge organization systems with hierarchical relationships and vocabulary control. A detailed bibliography of current research in collaborative tagging is included.},

  abstract = {The computing world is based on one principal system of conventions -- the simulation of hierarchy and the simulation of paper. The article introduces an entirely different system of conventions for data and computing. zzstructure is a generalized representation for all data and a new set of mechanisms for all computing. The article provides a reference description of zzstructure and what we hope to build on it.
 
 From orthogonally connected data items (zzcells) and untyped connections (zzlinks), we build a cross-connected fabric of data (zzstructure) that is visualizable, interactive, and programmable.
 
 zzstructure does not have a canonical string representation, as is usual. It is essentially spatial. It is based on criss-crossed lists of cells which are assigned to dimensions. Along these dimensions the cells are viewable, traversible, and subject to operations.
 
This leads to programming mechanisms built on this fabric; a virtual interactive machine (zzvim) built on these mechanisms; new visualization techniques built on the data fabric and mechanisms; and proposed new formats for the general representation of documents and arbitrary structure -- perhaps less biased than XML.},

  abstract = {This article is the second step in our research into the Symbol Grounding Problem (SGP). In a previous work, we defined the main condition that must be satisfied by any strategy in order to provide a valid solution to the SGP, namely the zero semantic commitment condition (Z condition). We then showed that all the main strategies proposed so far fail to satisfy the Z condition, although they provide several important lessons to be followed by any new proposal. Here, we develop a new solution of the SGP. It is called praxical in order to stress the key role played by the interactions between the agents and their environment. It is based on a new theory of meaning – Action-based Semantics (AbS) – and on a new kind of artificial agents, called twomachine artificial agents (AM²). Thanks to their architecture, AM2s implement AbS, and this allows them to ground their symbols semantically and to develop some fairly advanced semantic abilities, including the development of semantically grounded communication and the elaboration of representations, while still respecting the Z condition.},

After a concise introduction, we provide an analysis of the requirement that must be satisfied by any hypothesis seeking to solve the SGP, the zero semantical commitment condition. We then use it to assess the eight strategies, which are organised into three main approaches: representationalism, semi-representationalism and non-representationalism. The conclusion is that all the strategies are semantically committed and hence that none of them provides a valid solution to the SGP, which remains an open problem.},

  abstract = {By "identity conditions" we mean a method for determining whether an object x and an object y are the same object. Identity conditions are arguably an essential feature of any rigorously developed conceptual framework for information modeling. Surprisingly, the concept of same document, which is fundamental to many aspects of library and information science, and to digital libraries in particular, has received little systematic analysis. As a result, not only is the concept of a document itself under-theorized, but progress on a number of important practical problems has been hindered. We review the importance of document identity conditions, demonstrate problems with current approaches, and discuss the general form a solution must take. We then describe our own strategy, based on the BECHAMEL XML Semantics Project--we propose to reduce the relatively elusive and undefined general problem of determining document identity to the comparatively wellunderstood problem of proving logical equivalence in predicate logic. This approach should also enable the determination of semantic relationships other than identity, including similarities and partial identities of various kinds, and will support new strategies in various areas of digital information management, such as preservation, conversion, integrity assurance, retrieval, federation, metadata, and identifiers. Our results complement and extend discussions of the IFLA/FRBR entities (particularly "expression" and "manifestation") taking place in the cataloguing communityt discussions of "resource" taking place in the W3C and Dublin Core communities, and the analysis of similar notions in ontology development for digital libraries, museums and archives. Although our project is still in a preliminary phase, a working inferencing environment, in object-oriented Prolog, has been completed and initial results that confirm our logic-based strategy.},

The format became the foundation for automated systems for libraries that took data sharing to new levels and enabled exploitation of future computer developments to create today's online catalog environment. This article describes the complexity of the library application, how the MARC format was innovative, and why it was the foundation of automated systems development in libraries},

At the same time a large business community was developing that offered products based on the format to the library community. The introduction of the Internet in the 1990s and the Web technology brought new opportunities and challenges and the format was adapted to this new environment. There has been a great deal of international adoption of the format that has continued into the 2000s. More recently new syntaxes for MARC 21 and models are being explored.},

  abstract = {A graph is a data structure composed of dots (i.e. vertices) and lines (i.e. edges). The dots and lines of a graph can be organized into intricate arrangements. The ability for a graph to denote objects and their relationships to one another allow for a surprisingly large number of things to be modeled as a graph. From the dependencies that link software packages to the wood beams that provide the framing to a house, most anything has a corresponding graph representation. However, just because it is possible to represent something as a graph does not necessarily mean that its graph representation will be useful. If a modeler can leverage the plethora of tools and algorithms that store and process graphs, then such a mapping is worthwhile. This article explores the world of graphs in computing and exposes situations in which graphical models are beneficial.},

Any XML document is part of a set of XML documents that are logically equivalent within an application context, but which vary in physical representation based on syntactic changes permitted by XML 1.0 and Namespaces in XML 1.0. This specification describes a method for generating a physical representation, the canonical form, of an XML document that accounts for the permissible changes. Except for limitations regarding a few unusual cases, if two documents have the same canonical form, then the two documents are logically equivalent within the given application context. Note that two documents may have differing canonical forms yet still be equivalent in a given context based on application-specific equivalence rules for which no generalized XML specification could account. Canonical XML Version 1.1 is applicable to XML 1.0 and defined in terms of the XPath 1.0 data model. It is not defined for XML 1.1.},

@article{terHofstede1998,
  abstract = {In recent years, a number of proposals have been made to extend conventional conceptual data modeling techniques with concepts for modeling complex object structures. Among the most prominent proposed concepts is the concept of collection type. A collection type is an object type of which the instances are sets of instances of an other object type. A drawback of the introduction of such a new concept is that the formal definition of the technique involved becomes considerably more complex. This is a result of the fact that collection types are populatable types and such types tend to complicate updates. In this paper it is shown how a new kind of constraint, the extensional uniqueness constraint, allows for an alternative treatment of collection types avoiding update problems. The formal definition of this constraint type is presented, other advantages of its introduction are discussed, and its consequences for, among others, identification schemes are elaborated.},

It is based on a formal model that subsumes those of traditional finding aids such as indexes, glossaries, and thesauri, and extends them to cater for the additional complexities of digital information. Topic Maps is increasingly used in enterprise information integration, knowledge management, e-learning, and digital libraries, and as the foundation for Web-based information delivery solutions. This entry provides a comprehensive treatment of the core concepts, as well as describing the background and current status of the standard and its relationship to traditional knowledge organization techniques.},

@inproceedings{Stonebraker2007,
  abstract = {In previous papers, some of us predicted the end of "one size fits all" as a commercial relational DBMS paradigm. These papers presented reasons and experimental evidence that showed that the major RDBMS vendors can be outperformed by 1-2 orders of magnitude by specialized engines in the data warehouse, stream processing, text, and scientific database markets. Assuming that specialized engines dominate these markets over time, the current relational DBMS code lines will be left with the business data processing (OLTP) market and hybrid markets where more than one kind of capability is required. In this paper we show that current RDBMSs can be beaten by nearly two orders of magnitude in the OLTP market as well. The experimental evidence comes from comparing a new OLTP prototype, H-Store, which we have built at M.I.T. to a popular RDBMS on the standard transactional benchmark, TPC-C. We conclude that the current RDBMS code lines, while attempting to be a "one size fits all" solution, in fact, excel at nothing. Hence, they are 25 year old legacy code lines that should be retired in favor of a collection of "from scratch" specialized engines. The DBMS vendors (and the research community) should start with a clean sheet of paper and design systems for tomorrow's requirements, not continue to push code lines and architectures designed for yesterday's needs.},

  abstract = {Even though object-oriented development was introduced in the late 1960s (beginning with the Simula programming language), OO development has not yet lived up to its promises. A major stumbling block to reaping the promised benefits is learning the OO approach. One reason that learning OO is so difficult may be that we do not yet thoroughly understand the fundamental concepts that define the OO approach. When reviewing the body of work on OO development, most authors simply suggest a set of concepts that characterize OO, and move on with their research or discussion. Thus, they are either taking for granted that the concepts are known or implicitly acknowledging that a universal set of concepts does not exist. Several authors, asserting there is no clear definition of the essence of OO, have called for the development of a consensus. While a few have tried to develop such a consensus, to date a thorough review of the literature and identification of the fundamental concepts of the OO approach has been lacking. The goal of this article is twofold: to identify and describe the fundamental concepts, or quarks, of object-oriented development, and identify how these concepts fit together into a coherent scheme.},

Revising the code that performed the task confronted him with his own misconceptions about MARC that were rooted in his worldview about what he thought “structured data” should be and helped him to place MARC in a more appropriate context.},

  abstract = {A common problem of ontologies is that their taxonomic structure is often poor and confusing. This is typically exemplified by the unrestrained use of subsumption to accomplish a variety of tasks. In this paper we show how a formal ontology of unary properties can help using the subsumption relation in a disciplined way. This formal ontology is based on some meta-properties built around the fundamental philosophical notions of identity, unity, essence, and dependence. These meta-properties impose some constraints on the subsumption relation that clarify many misconceptions about taxonomies, facilitating their understanding, comparison and integration.},

@article{Floridi2003a,
  abstract = {There is no consensus yet on the definition of semantic information. This paper contributes to the current debate by criticising and revising the Standard Definition of semantic Information (SDI) as meaningful data, in favour of the Dretske-Grice approach: meaningful and well-formed data constitute semantic information only if they also qualify as contingently truthful. After a brief introduction, SDI is criticised for providing necessary but insufficient conditions for the definition of semantic information. SDI is incorrect because truth-values do not supervene on semantic information, and misinformation (that is, false semantic information) is not a type of semantic information, but pseudo-information, that is not semantic information at all. This is shown by arguing that none of the reasons for interpreting misinformation as a type of semantic information is convincing, whilst there are compelling reasons to treat it as pseudo-information. As a consequence, SDI is revised to include a necessary truth-condition. The last section summarises the main results of the paper and indicates the important implications of the revised definition for the analysis of the deflationary theories of truth, the standard definition of knowledge and the classic, quantitative theory of semantic information.},

  abstract = {Other disciplines now lay claim to research topics belonging to the domain of IS research, and the field itself is under challenge in academic institutions around the world. Thus having a clear conception of those concepts lying at the core of our field and which establish the legitimacy of Information Systems (IS) as an independent discipline is more important than ever before. This manuscript seeks to contribute a clearer understanding of what we mean by the central issues driving the field. But this manuscript takes a new twist by approaching this question from the point of view of a set of French IS scholars and social theorists. It advances the discourse by examining how French scholars, many of whom are not well known outside of French academic circles, may impact our reading of those issues considered to be most persistent and frequent in the IS literature.},

@article{Boyd2005,
  abstract = {Data integration is frequently performed between heterogeneous data sources, requiring that not only a schema, but also the data modelling language in which that schema is represented must be transformed between one data source and another. This paper describes an extension to the hypergraph data model(HDM), used in the AutoMed data integration approach, that allows constraint constructs found in static data modelling languages to be represented by a small set of primitive constraint operators in the HDM. In addition, a set of five equivalence preserving transformation rules are defined that operate over this extended HDM. These transformation rules are shown to allow a bidirectional mapping to be defined between equivalent relational, ER, UML and ORM schemas. The approach we propose provides a precise framework in which to compare data modelling languages, and precisely identifies what semantics of a particular domain one data model may express that another data model may not express. The approach also forms the platform for further work in automating the process of transforming between different data modelling languages. The use of the both-as-view approach to data integration means that a bidirectional
 association is produced between schemas in the data modelling language. Hence a further advantage of the approach is that composition of data mappings may be performed such that mapping two schemas to one common schema will produce a bidirectional mapping between the original two data sources.},

@mastersthesis{Nielson2006,
  abstract = {This thesis is about relations between schema languages for XML. A schema language is a formal definition of the syntax of an XML language and is used to check validity of a given XML document. There exists a variety of schema languages mainly developed around 2000. During the last six years some of the languages have matured and become either W3C or ISO standards, some have stabilized and some have vanished. Most of the
languages have been stable in terms of language features during the last three years. Due to the stability of the schema languages, it is a good moment in time to take a step back and try to see the overall perspective of schema languages; for schema language designers to learn from the existing experiences and for schema language users to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the individual languages and so be better qualified the
choose the right language for a given application. Revealing relations between six state of the art schema languages for XML, DTD, XML Schema, Schematron, DSD2, RELAX NG, and Summary Graphs, gives a good insight into
the various perspectives of schema languages. The relations will be revealed using a twofold approach: first, we present a thorough feature-based comparison of schema languages and second, we present and investigate translations between the schema languages. This strategy gives us a strong basis from which we can point out the strengths and weaknesses of each language and conclude that the all-optimal schema language has yet to come.},

Unlike data models, the fundamental asset of ontologies is their relative independence of particular applications, i.e. an ontology consists of relatively generic knowledge that can be reused by different kinds of applications/tasks. The first part of this paper concerns some aspects that help to understand the differences and similarities between ontologies and data models. In the second part we present an ontology engineering framework that supports and favours the genericity of an ontology. We introduce the DOGMA ontology engineering approach that separates "atomic" conceptual relations from "predicative" domain rules. A DOGMA ontology consists of an ontology base that holds sets of intuitive context-specific conceptual relations and a layer of "relatively generic" ontological commitments that hold the domain rules. This constitutes what we shall call the double articulation of a DOGMA ontology.},

XML schema, ModelGen can automatically generate an equiva-
lent relational schema or Java interface. This paper describes a
new algorithm for ModelGen with several novel properties. It
automatically determines a series of transformations to generate
the target model. It generates forward- and reverse-views that
transform instances of the source model into instances of the
target and back again. It supports rich mappings of inheritance

demonstrate its practicality in an implementation.

@article{Madalli2008,
  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose the use of unified modelling language (UML) based ontologies to develop a faceted model to facilitate semantic browsing and searching in digital libraries.
Design/methodology/approach – The approach is to understand the way information gets logically organised in the human mind in terms of mutually defined concepts. Ontologies will be used to model the semantic structure of individual information sources using the faceted classification schema of Dr S.R. Ranganathan, though with improvisation to accommodate new concepts relating to digital resources.
Findings – UML can be the best option for knowledge representation if the target system is a digital library where the required type of reasoning about ontologies is more in terms of answering specific and specialised questions. Here, ontologies can be used to facilitate a distributed information retrieval system.
Originality/value – The proposed model will not only facilitate semantic searching using UML concept maps but will also enable domain experts, even those with little coding expertise, to build ontologies for their resources while submitting their documents to the digital library.

  abstract = {Flat graphical, conceptual modeling techniques are widely accepted as visually effective ways in which to specify and communicate the conceptual data requirements of an information system. Conceptual schema diagrams provide modelers with a picture of the salient structures underlying the modeled
universe of discourse, in a form that can readily be understood by and communicated to users, programmers and managers. When complexity and size of applications increase, however, the success of these techniques in terms of comprehensibility and communicability deteriorates rapidly.

This paper proposes a method to offset this deterioration, by adding abstraction layers to ﬂat conceptual schemas. We present an algorithm to recursively derive higher levels of abstraction from a given (ﬂat) conceptual schema. The driving force of this algorithm is a hierarchy of conceptual importance among the elements of the universe of discourse.},

@article{Cranefield2007,
  abstract = {Software engineers have many robust commercial tools available to them for creating and manipulating models. Due to the widespread adoption of the Object Management Group (OMG) standards for metamodel definition, model serialisation and programmatic access to models, many of these tools are interoperable. Currently this is not the case for ontology engineering tools. This paper discusses the potential benefits of making the OMG's model-driven architecture (MDA) technology applicable to ontology engineering, and in particular, describes a technique for converting ontologies serialised using the XML metadata interchange (XMI) format to an equivalent representation using the resource description framework (RDF), without any loss of information. The resulting models can then be analysed and transformed using existing RDF tools. The technique is applicable to any ontology modelling language that has its abstract syntax defined using the OMG's meta-object facility (MOF) model.

This research helps to bridge the gap between the MDA and ontology engineering by providing a technique based on the familiar RDF language for defining transformations between other types of model (such as UML) and ontologies, between different ontology modelling languages, or to modify ontologies without changing the language.},

In other domains as well, such as textual criticism and library science, one can also find notions of text or document that are similarly difficult to reconcile with modification. We describe the problem and sketch some possible resolutions. Although the issues are conceptual and foundational the practical significance is real. Formal representation in logic-based ontology languages, increasingly important in information management, requires that familiar idioms, however serviceable and entrenched, be converted to expressions that support literal interpretation. },

Apart from basic Web technologies (URIs, HTTP, and HTML) and the advanced scripting driving the Web 2.0 wave, XML is by far the most successful and ubiquitous Web technology. With great power, however, comes great responsibility, so while XML's success is well earned as the first truly universal standard for structured data, it must now deal with numerous problems that have grown up around it. These are not entirely the fault of XML itself, but instead can be attributed to exaggerated claims and ideas of what XML is and what it can do.  This article is about the lessons gleaned from learning XML, from teaching XML, from dealing with overly optimistic assumptions about XML's powers, and from helping XML users in the real world recover from these misconceptions.},

  abstract = {The most popular bibliographical standards, which prescribe the exchange of bibliographical data in machine readable form, are MARC     (Machine Readable Cataloguing) and UNIMARC (Universal Machine Readable Cataloguing). This paper presents two schemas, both written in the XML schema language: the UNIMARC format schema and the XML bibliographical records schema. The instance of the UNIMARC format schema is an XML    document of UNIMARC format. This schema provides easier updating and adjusting of the UNIMARC format at the national or regional level. It    was also the basis for the development of the XML editor for UNIMARC format description. The instance of the XML bibliographical records    schema is an XML bibliographic record. This schema provides very thorough control of the contents and structure of bibliographical   records, whether they were directly created as XML records or converted to XML from existing UNIMARC records. The validation process is implemented in the Java environment, with the Sun Multi-Schema XML Validator (MSV) package. The author is aware of the inevitable question of redundant information contained in these two schemas and proposes some possible solutions.},

@phdthesis{Pourabdollah2009b,
  abstract = {This thesis proposes a new, highly generalised and fundamental, information-modelling framework called the TRM (Ternary Relations Model). The TRM was designed to be a model for converging a number of differing paradigms of information management, some of which are quite isolated. These include areas such as: hypertext navigation; relational databases; semi-structured databases; the Semantic Web; ZigZag and workflow modelling.

While many related works model linking by the connection of two ends, the TRM adds a third element to this, thereby enriching the links with associative meanings. The TRM is a formal description of a technique that establishes bi-directional and dynamic node-link structures in which each link is an ordered triple of three other nodes. The key features that makes the TRM distinct from other triple-based models (such as RDF) is the integration of bi-directionality, functional links and simplicity in the definition and elements hierarchy.

There are two useful applications of the TRM. Firstly it may be used as a tool for the analysis of information models, to elucidate connections and parallels. Secondly, it may be used as a “construction kit” to build new paradigms and/or applications in information management. The TRM may be used to provide a substrate for building diverse systems, such as adaptive hypertext, schemaless database, query languages, hyperlink models and workflow management systems. It is, however, highly generalised and is by no means limited to these purposes.},

@inproceedings{Ford2004,
  abstract = {For decades we have been using Chomsky's generative system of grammars, particularly context-free grammars (CFGs) and regular expressions (REs), to express the syntax of programming languages and protocols. The power of generative grammars to express ambiguity is crucial to their original purpose of modelling natural languages, but this very power makes it unnecessarily difficult both to express and to parse machine-oriented languages using CFGs. Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) provide an alternative, recognition-based formal foundation for describing machine-oriented syntax, which solves the ambiguity problem by not introducing ambiguity in the first place. Where CFGs express nondeterministic choice between alternatives, PEGs instead use prioritized choice. PEGs address frequently felt expressiveness limitations of CFGs and REs, simplifying syntax definitions and making it unnecessary to separate their lexical and hierarchical components. A linear-time parser can be built for any PEG, avoiding both the complexity and fickleness of LR parsers and the inefficiency of generalized CFG parsing. While PEGs provide a rich set of operators for constructing grammars, they are reducible to two minimal recognition schemas developed around 1970, TS/TDPL and gTS/GTDPL, which are here proven equivalent in effective recognition power.},

@book{Friedl2006,
  abstract = {Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool for manipulating text and data. They are now standard features in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB.NET and C-Sharp (and any language using the .NET Framework), PHP, and MySQL. If you don't use regular expressions yet, you will discover in this book a whole new world of mastery over your data. If you already use them, you'll appreciate this book's unprecedented detail and breadth of coverage. If you think you know all you need to know about regular expressions, this book is a stunning eye-opener. As this book shows, a command of regular expressions is an invaluable skill. Regular expressions allow you to code complex and subtle text processing that you never imagined could be automated. Regular expressions can save you time and aggravation. They can be used to craft elegant solutions to a wide range of problems. Once you've mastered regular expressions, they'll become an invaluable part of your toolkit. You will wonder how you ever got by without them. Yet despite their wide availability, flexibility, and unparalleled power, regular expressions are frequently underutilized. Yet what is power in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the unwary. Mastering Regular Expressions will help you navigate the minefield to becoming an expert and help you optimize your use of regular expressions. Mastering Regular Expressions, Third Edition, now includes a full chapter devoted to PHP and its powerful and expressive suite of regular expression functions, in addition to enhanced PHP coverage in the central "core" chapters. Furthermore, this edition has been updated throughout to reflect advances in other languages, including expanded in-depth coverage of Sun's java.util.regex package, which has emerged as the standard Java regex implementation.},

Examples are drawn from the Library and Information field to show how the view of documents is influenced by different cognitive models and how more complex understandings may be described in terms of clusters of models. Such a set of tools for discussing the concept will be particularly useful as we are facing a whole range of new types of ‘documents’ made possible by digital media. },

@article{Alur2009,
  abstract = {We propose the model of nested words for representation of data with both a linear ordering and a hierarchically nested matching of items. Examples of data with such dual linear-hierarchical structure include executions of structured programs, annotated linguistic data, and HTML/XML documents. Nested words generalize both words and ordered trees, and allow both word and tree operations. We define nested word automata—finite-state acceptors for nested words, and show that the resulting class of regular languages of nested words has all the appealing theoretical properties that the classical regular word languages enjoys: deterministic nested word automata are as expressive as their nondeterministic counterparts; the class is closed under union, intersection, complementation, concatenation, Kleene-*, prefixes, and language homomorphisms; membership, emptiness, language inclusion, and language equivalence are all decidable; and definability in monadic second order logic corresponds exactly to finite-state recognizability. We also consider regular languages of infinite nested words and show that the closure properties, MSO-characterization, and decidability of decision problems carry over. The linear encodings of nested words give the class of visibly pushdown languages of words, and this class lies between balanced languages and deterministic context-free languages. We argue that for algorithmic verification of structured programs, instead of viewing the program as a context-free language over words, one should view it as a regular language of nested words (or equivalently, a visibly pushdown language), and this would allow model checking of many properties (such as stack inspection, pre-post conditions) that are not expressible in existing specification logics. We also study the relationship between ordered trees and nested words, and the corresponding automata: while the analysis complexity of nested word automata is the same as that of classical tree automata, they combine both bottom-up and top-down traversals, and enjoy expressiveness and succinctness benefits over tree automata.},

  abstract = {Metadata -- data about data -- is a comparatively new word which describes a concept which has been around for a very long time in the form of catalogues and lists of publications. The advent of computers and the recognition of data and information as corporate assets, however, has produced in the past decade a new vocabulary of terms and concepts by which to describe data and information. Terms such as directory, catalogue, inventory, attribute and metadata itself are taking on new meanings as specialists endeavour to put some structure into this new activity. In addition, research in this area is advancing our understanding of metadata models and standards. This paper will present an overview of some of the work going on in this area.},

However, it is possible to define a large class of canonicalizable RDF graphs, such that digital signatures for graphs in this class can be created and verified in O(nlog(n)). Without changing its meaning, an arbitrary RDF graph can be nondeterministically pre-canonicalized into a graph of this class, before signing. The techniques in this paper are key enablers for the use of digital signature technology in the Semantic Web.},

This enables RDF statements that describe graphs, which is beneficial in many Semantic Web application areas. Named graphs are given an abstract syntax, a formal semantics, an XML syntax, and a syntax based on N3. SPARQL is a query language applicable to named graphs. A specific application area discussed in detail is that of describing provenance information. This paper provides a formally defined framework suited to being a foundation for the Semantic Web trust layer.},

The recent history of LIS and the practice of professional library work are examined for evidence of the basis for making claims about LIS. A view of information based on individual interpretations is preferred to Floridi’s account, which is found to be too innocent of LIS practice to be accepted without revision, as is his view of LIS as an applied PI.},

@article{Floridi2005,
  abstract = {There is no consensus yet on the definition of semantic information. This paper contributes to the current debate by criticising and revising the Standard Definition of semantic Information (SDI) as meaningful data, in favour of the Dretske-Grice approach: meaningful and well-formed data constitute semantic information only if they also qualify as contingently truthful. After a brief introduction, SDI is criticised for providing necessary but insufficient conditions for the definition of semantic information. SDI is incorrect because truth-values do not supervene on semantic information, and misinformation (that is, false semantic information) is not a type of semantic information, but pseudo-information, that is not semantic information at all. This is shown by arguing that none of the reasons for interpreting misinformation as a type of semantic information is convincing, whilst there are compelling reasons to treat it as pseudo-information. As a consequence, SDI is revised to include a necessary truth-condition. The last section summarises the main results of the paper and indicates some interesting areas of application of the revised definition.},

The official protocol includes standard queries and their responses and most of the Internet class data formats (e.g., host addresses). However, the domain system is intentionally extensible. Researchers are continuously proposing, implementing and experimenting with new data types, query types, classes, functions, etc. Thus while the components of the official protocol are expected to stay essentially unchanged and operate as a production service, experimental behavior should always be expected in extensions beyond the official protocol. Experimental or obsolete features are clearly marked in these RFCs, and such information should be used with caution. The reader is especially cautioned not to depend on the values which appear in examples to be current or complete, since their purpose is primarily pedagogical.

  abstract = {In this article, Novak's concept mapping technique is compared to three other types of visualization formats, namely mind maps, conceptual diagrams, and visual metaphors. The application parameters and the respective advantages and disadvantages of each format for learning and knowledge sharing are reviewed and discussed. It is argued that the combination of these four visualization types can play to the strength of each one. The article then provides real-life examples from such a use in undergraduate and graduate university teaching. The results provide first indications that the different visualization formats can be used in complementary ways to enhance motivation, attention, understanding and recall. The implications for a complementary use of these visualization formats in class room and meeting contexts are discussed and a future research agenda in this domain is articulated.},

The overall variety of modelling languages can be explained by an evolutionary process that exhibits regularities.Evolution has been studied extensively in biology and linguistics. From the results of these studies, hypotheses on the causes, mechanisms and directions of the evolution of entity-relationship (ER) modelling are derived and tested, using a sample of 100 ER models. The empirical results lead to theory of the evolution of modelling languages.},

  abstract = {Existing schema languages can lead to overdesign. They offer more choices than are necessary for purely descriptive (as contrasted with prescriptive) situations. A potential solution is to design based on "patterns" from real DTDs. Using three example situations, alternatives, repeatable homogeneous elements, and mixed content models, we derived a group of patterns sufficient to express all required structures in a descriptive environment. To provide a meaningful example, we propose a new instance-based schema language, DTD--, that derives schemas from tagged sample instances according to the patterns. Since there are few patterns, every document can be represented by a simple grammar where grammar rules can be directly inferred from the document, without any ambiguity.},

This paper proposes a tool that supports the authors in their tasks of selection and grouping the learning material. The ‘à la’ (Associative Linking of Attributes) in Education, enhances the search engine results by extracting the attributes (keywords and document formats) from the text. The relationships between the attributes are established and visualised in a novel hypertext paradigm using the ZigZag principles. Browsing the related metadata provides a quick summary of the document and can hence help in faster determining its relevancy. Also, the proposed solution enables better understanding of why some resources are grouped together as well as providing suggestions for the further searches. The results of a user trial indicate high levels of user satisfaction and effectiveness.},

This article is one of a group of four articles, which resulted from a Critical Delphi study conducted in 2003–2005. The study, "Knowledge Map of Information Science," was aimed at exploring the foundations of information science. The international panel was composed of 57 leading scholars from 16 countries, who represent (almost) all the major subfields and important aspects of the field. This particular article documents 130 definitions of data, information, and knowledge formulated by 45 scholars, and maps the major conceptual approaches for defining these three key concepts.

  abstract = {Identity is that property of an object which distinguishes each object from all others. Identity has been investigated almost independently in general-purpose programming languages and database languages. Its importance is growing as these two environments evolve and merge. We describe a continuum between weak and strong support of identity, and argue for the incorporation of the strong notion of identity at the conceptual level in languages for general purpose programming, database systems and their hybrids. We define a data model that can directly describe complex objects, and show that identity can easily be incorporated in it. Finally, we compare different implementation schemes for identity and argue that a surrogate-based implementation scheme is needed to support the strong notion of identity.},

  abstract = {Three meanings of information are distinguished: Information-as-process; information-as-knowledge; and information-as-thing, the attributive use of information to denote things regarded as informative. The nature and characteristics of information-as-thing are discussed, using an indirect approach (What things are informative?). Varieties of information-as-thing include data, text, documents, objects, and events. On this view information includes but extends beyond communication. Whatever information storage and retrieval systems store and retrieve is necessarily information-as-thing.  These three meanings of information, along with information processing, offer a basis for classifying disparate information-related activities (e.g., rhetoric, bibliographic retrieval, statistical analysis) and, thereby, suggest a topography for information science.},

  abstract = {The infrastructure of a typical search engine can be used to calculate and resolve persistent document identifiers: a string that can uniquely identify and locate a document on the Internet without reference to its original location (URL). Bookmarking a document using such an identifier allows its retrieval even if the document's URL, and, in many cases, its contents change. Web client applications can offer facilities for users to bookmark a page by reference to a search engine and the persistent identifier instead of the original URL. The identifiers are calculated using a global Internet term index; a document's unique identifier consists of a word or word combination that occurs uniquely in the specific document. We use a genetic algorithm to locate a minimal unique document identifier: the shortest word or word combination that will locate the document. We tested our approach by implementing tools for indexing a document collection, calculating the persistent identifiers, performing queries, and distributing the computation and storage load among many computers.},

  abstract = {THE KINDS OF FILE structures required if we are to use the computer for personal files and as an adjunct to creativity are wholly different in character from those customary in business and scientific data processing. They need to provide the capacity for intricate and idiosyncratic arrangements, total modifiability, undecided alternatives, and thorough internal documentation. I want to explain how some ideas developed and what they are. The original problem was to specify a computer system for personal information retrieval and documentation, able to do some rather complicated things in clear and simple ways. In this paper I will explain the original problem. Then I will explain why the problem is not simple, and why the solution (a file structure) must yet be very simple. The file structure suggested here is the Evolutionary List File, to be built of zippered lists. A number of uses will be suggested for such a file, to show the breadth of its potential usefulness. Finally, I want to explain the philosophical implications of this approach for information retrieval and data structure in a changing world.},

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on formally representing life cycle semantics of part-whole relations in conceptual data models by utilizing the temporal modality. We approach this by resorting to the temporal conceptual data modelling language ERvt and extend it with the novel notion of status relations. This enables a precise axiomatization of the constraints for essential parts and wholes compared to mandatory parts and wholes, as well as introduction of temporally suspended partwhole relations. To facilitate usage in the conceptual stage of information systems development, a set of closed questions and decision diagram are proposed. The long-term objectives are to ascertain which type of shareability and which lifetime aspects are possible for part-whole relations, investigate the formal semantics for sharability, and how to model these kind of differences in conceptual data models.},

@article{Nelson1999,
  abstract = {Project Xanadu, the original hypertext project, is often misunderstood as an attempt to create the World Wide Web. It has always been much more ambitious, proposing an entire form of literature where links do not break as versions change; where documents may be closely compared side by side and closely annotated; where it is possible to see the origins of every quotation; and in which there is a valid copyright system --- a literary, legal and business arrangement --- for frictionless, non-negotiated quotation at any time and in any amount. The Web trivialized this original Xanadu model, vastly but incorrectly simplifying these problems to a world of fragile ever-breaking oneway links, with no recognition of change or copyright, and no support for multiple versions or principled re-use. Fonts and glitz, rather than content connective structure, prevail. Serious electronic literature (for scholarship, detailed controversy and detailed collaboration) must support bidirectional and profuse links, which cannot be embedded; and must offer facilities for easily tracking re-use on a principled basis among versions and quotations. Xanalogical literary structure is a unique symmetrical connective system for text (and other separable media elements), with two complementary forms of connection that achieve these functions --- survivable deep linkage (content links) and recognizable, visible re-use (transclusion). Both of these are easily implemented by a document model using content lists which reference stabilized media. This system of literary structure offers uniquely integrated methods for version management, side-by-side comparison and visualizable re-use, which lead to a radically beneficial and principled copyright system (endorsed in principle by the ACM). Though dauntingly far from the standards which have presently caught on, this design is still valid and may yet find a place in the evolving Internet universe.},

  abstract = {The Semantic Web is a vision for the future of the Web in which information is given explicit meaning, making it easier for machines to automatically process and integrate information available on the Web. Semantic Web will build on the well known Semantic Web language stack, part of which is the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, extensible programming language, which provides an excellent combination of clarity and versatility. The deep integration of both languages is one of the novel approaches for enabling free and interoperable data [1]. In this article we present a metaclass-based implementation of the deep
integration ideas. The implementation is an early Python prototype supporting in-line class and properties declaration, instance creation and simple triple-based queries. The implementation is backed up by a well
known OWL-DL reasoner Pellet [3]. The integration of the Python and OWL-DL through meta-class programming provides a unique approach, which can be implemented with any metaclass enabled scripting language.},

Its primary goal is to enable efficient and reliable communication across programming languages by abstracting the portions of each language that tend to require the most customization into a common library that is implemented in each language. Specifically, Thrift allows developers to define datatypes and service interfaces in a single language-neutral file and generate all the necessary code to build RPC clients and servers.^M

The volume presents the current state of the art in examining the expression of relationships in some of the best thesauri and classification schemes in use throughout the world. It also looks to the future by providing guidance for relational tasks now taking on greater significance, as retrieval systems increasingly operate in automated modes and as retrieval systems cross linguistic, cultural, and disciplinary boundaries. By bringing together in one place the perspectives of some of the most prominent persons working in this arena, this volume should be of interest to researchers from library and information science, as well as computer science (artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, information retrieval, natural language processing), and to many practitioners, including: developers of thesauri and classification schemes; developers of Web search engines and search directories; indexers and subject cataloguers; and professional searchers.},

For the time being, however, most repository managers can only control their own name lists as best they can after deposit while they advocate for better systems and services.},

@inproceedings{Halpin2009,
  abstract = {One could hypothesize that the essential bet of the Web is that in a decentralized information space multiple agents can share the meaning of a URI. On the Semantic Web, does a URI get its meaning from its owner, or from the formal interpretation of statements that use it? We consider the positions of Berners-Lee and Hayes, comparing them to the descriptivist and causal theories of names, and giving the common problems of both of them. We reconcile these viewpoints by explicating the public language theory of meaning, where names are fundamentally given their meaning by social and linguistic agreement. This position was first articulated by Wittgenstein in a repudiation of his earlier strongly logicist viewpoint. This view is ultimately compatible with Frege, wherein the meaning of any expression, including URIs, are grounded out not just in their formal truth values, but in their sense. The notion of sense can be reconstructed to be construed in terms of the socially-grounded norms that are necessary in order to grasp the use of a name across a language. Thus, the infamous slogan "meaning is use" arises. For a name in a public language to be successful, it must be adopted by a community, who in turn comes unto some sort of minimal, and so often ambiguous and unconscious, agreement on the use of a name. We demonstrate a system that inspects the aggregate behavior of search engine users to approximate the social meaning of URIs. We present a system and a experiment using a search engine query log from a major search engine and real Linked Data in order to test the system. We then conclude by asserting that a study of social meaning is essential to Web Science. As put by Berners-Lee, "We are not analyzing a world, we are building it. We are not experimental philosophers, we are philosophical engineers."},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the relations between philosophy of information (PI), library and
information science (LIS) and social epistemology (SE). In the rst section, it is
argued that there is a natural relation between philosophy and LIS but that SE
cannot provide a satisfactory foundation for LIS. SE should rather be seen as sharing
with LIS a common ground, represented by the study of information, to be
investigated by a new discipline, PI. In the second section, the nature of PI is
outlined as the philosophical area that studies the conceptual nature of information,
its dynamics and problems. In the third section, LIS is de ned as a form of applied
PI. The hypothesis supported is that PI should replace SE as the philosophical
discipline that can best provide the conceptual foundation for LIS. In the conclusion,
it is suggested that the ‘identity’ crisis undergone by LIS has been the natural
outcome of a justi ed but precocious search for a philosophical counterpart that has
emerged only recently: namely, PI. The development of LIS should not rely on some
borrowed, pre-packaged theory. As applied PI, LIS can fruitfully contribute to the
growth of basic theoretical research in PI itself and thus provide its own foundation.},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to show that aspects of the entity–relationship data modelling method, for the analysis of systems, are not well understood in the commercial domain. Practitioner knowledge of available semantic constructs in the entity–relationship model is measured, together with practitioner perceptions of analyst and client data modelling knowledge. A set of criteria is used to establish practitioner perceptions concerning the usability of data models within the analysis process. The findings provide evidence that practitioners do not understand some key semantic constructs and perceive that other analysts and clients have an incomplete understanding of available model semantics. This empirical evidence from the commercial domain may be useful in improving the effectiveness of the data modelling method through training and further research.},
