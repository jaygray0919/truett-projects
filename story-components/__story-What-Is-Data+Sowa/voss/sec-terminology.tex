\section{A structural typology of data structuring [+4-5]}
\label{sec:typology}


\TODO{Glossary with consistent typology of core concepts.}

% me: schema languages are formal languages and rules with human-readable annotations.

% Given data and structure: What is the meaning? Meaning is often not
% obvious and/or fuzzy!

% data vs. information
% (have not used this word before, but in:
% 'metadata includes any information about digital or non-digital content,'
% what does ``includes'' mean?

% my terminology: data structuring = data encoding


% Some more precise research questions:

% How is metadata structured?
% How is metadata structured/encoded?
% What types of metadata structuring methods exist?
% How do the types of metadata structuring methods differ?
% How do the types of metadata structuring methods relate to each other?
% What patterns in metadata structuring exist?
% what is a language?
% what is a format?

% \item what are entities?
% \item what is formalizing?
% \item what is modeling?
% \item what is metadata?
% \item what is a standard?
% \item what is bibliographic data?
% \item how can data be processed?
% \item what is data modeling?
% \item what is identity?

\TODO{
This section presents a structural typology of metadata derived from the
survey in the previous chapter. We will determine several distinct types
of metadata encoding methods
}

%See my 'An algebraic structure of formats, models, and schemas'
% as a result?

In this section we will answer the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item What types of metadata encoding methods exist?
 \item How do the types of metadata encoding methods differ?
 \item How do the types of metadata encoding methods relate to each other?
\end{itemize}

% CSV= \Seq{\Seq{\formati{UInt}{8}}} ?

% For the results
%\begin{eqnarray*}
% \format{UTF-8}: \format{u:String} \mapsto \Seq{ \format{Byte} } \\
%\end{eqnarray*}

% meaning is structure
% Sperberg-McQueen 2000 ``Meaning and Interpretation of Markup``

% Markup: syntax (tree vs event), syntax, escaping, supported characters...
%
%Each syntax may restrict the set of expressable character strings
%Tree is good to enforce specific kind of nesting (see ch~X for about trees).
%Some markup is character-based flags:

% Findings from markup languages:
% 1. Youn can migrate from one DSL to another (\acro{SGML} to \acro{XML}).
% 2. difference between presentational and descriptive is difficult
% 3. Use of Macros to add descriptive markup,
% 4. ML focus un syntax. Two ways: (tree vs. event-based)

% finding: citation styles are markup languages for output

% \acro{DSL}s are most used to is lies on the exchange of data structures
% between different programming languages and applications. 
% clear and strict specification, availability of reference implementations
% event-stream !! (YAML)
% with or without type information

% Interesting type systems: J, Haskell

If data in a database is restricted to a specific \tacro{data structuring
language}{DSL}, the database can also be seen as simple file system. The
database model is then implied by the underlying \acro{DSL}'s model 
(\ref{sec:dsl}).

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
  XML & ordered trees with node properties \\
  JSON & trees with typed leafs and support of indexed or ordered edges \\
  YAML &  a more powerful superset of JSON (\ref{sec:yaml}) \\
  CSV & tabular data, spreadsheets \ref{sec:csvandini}) \ldots
\end{tabular}


% Null values in data base management a denotational semantics approach (1978)
% Even no data has a value (1984)

% The importance of normalization ... but not at the logical level!

% Neue Ergebnisse, die Ã¼ber die Literatur in \ref{ch:foundations} hinausgehen.

The Typology used in the previous chapter (\ref{ch:methods}) defines less
groups but more dimensions. In practice we rarely have pure schemes,
formats, identifiers etc. but languages that work (and/or are used) on
multiple levels at the same time. 

% Q: If logical and conceptual are well divided. Why not easy to map each of
% (UML, ORM, ERM\ldots) to (Relational, XML-DB, RDF-DB, Network-DB etc.)?

\TODO{I must better explain why this section is about \emph{meta}data in
particular while I talk about data in general.}

\TODO{I am not sure if my triangle method (format, rules, practice) fits
in here and whether it still the best way to classify metadata standards.}
