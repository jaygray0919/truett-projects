AMP logo guidelines
The following guidelines apply to logos for all AMP pages, including AMP stories.
    The file must be a raster file, such as .jpg, .png, or .gif.
    Don't use vector files, such as .svg or .eps.
    Don't use animation.
    The graphic part of the logo should be legible on the background color.

The logo should fit in a 60x600px rectangle, and either be exactly 60px high (preferred), or exactly 600px wide.
For example, 450x45px would not be acceptable, even though it fits within the 600x60px rectangle.
