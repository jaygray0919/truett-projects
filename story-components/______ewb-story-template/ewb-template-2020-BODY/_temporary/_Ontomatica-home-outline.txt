An electronic label for pizza handles complexity by linking structured data from many sources into graphs.

Structured data describes flavors, ingredients and formulations.

Structured data also describes how a pizza and its components were sourced, combined and packaged.

A graph that combines structured data about a product's characteristics is packaged as an electroninc label.

An electronic label is machine&#x2010;readable and is a data source for data&#x2010;driven machines.

Electronic labels can be combined to make new labels for new products.

For humans, electronic labels can be published and spoken in 27 national languages.
