hello Matias

quick progress report

we are using the latest amp-story-page-attachment: 
  <amp-story-page-attachment layout="nodisplay" theme="custom" cta-image="" cta-text="" data-title="">
and amp-story-page-outlink:
  <amp-story-page-outlink layout="nodisplay" theme="custom" cta-accent-color="" cta-accent-element="" cta-image=""><a href=""></a></amp-story-page-outlink>

definite improvement!

we're using preload for the PDFs to overcome the arbitrary loading by google doc viewer
  <link rel="preload" as="fetch" type="application/pdf" href="file.pdf" crossorigin />

we minimized our iframe code and it is now amp-valid:
  https://afdsi.com/___supplier/paula-perez/story-22-04-03/#page=item-36

we've added amp-shopping-attachment to our template:
  https://afdsi.com/___supplier/paula-perez/story-22-04-03/#page=item-37
in the future we will use it for component information about foods, drugs, cosmetics and textiles

we are wrangling with the endpoint. here is a test link that fails:
  https://afdsi.com/___supplier/paula-perez/reference/results/results.json
what are doing wrong there?
chrome dev pukes on these links

our last issue is selectors in tabs. see:
  https://afdsi.com/___supplier/paula-perez/story-22-04-03/#page=item-37
the <img> tag is now valid for amp-html but fails for amp-story
we tried to use <amp-img> but only the first image is displayed when using <amp-img> for all images
but <img> works and should be valid in amp-story if it is valid for amp-html

we have solved, but not yet implements our target @media directives
our Story looks great on mobile and tablets, landscape and portrait

here is the validator link that identifies issues:
  https://validator.ampproject.org/#url=https%3A%2F%2Fafdsi.com%2F___supplier%2Fpaula-perez%2Fstory-22-04-03%2F

would you consider relaxing those limits?

our customers are very happy abou this template!
thank you and your team for a great product.
