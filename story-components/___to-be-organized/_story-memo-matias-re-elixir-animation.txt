Hello Matias
I know from the Story concalls and other sources that you folks have many competing priorities
And I'm sure you are tracking the competitve landscape for challengers to Web Stories
Some challengers are dedicated to the mobile platform like: https://signal.org/blog/introducing-stories/

But my organization sees Web Stories as a superior way "to do Powerpoint" - a combination of diagrams and text for "Presentations"
The amp-story-page-grid and attachments (with iframes and other interactive services) is very powerful
And we plan to lay in an audio script so the Presentation has a virtual Presenter

You've helped us with Story Player - a navigator thru a Presentation
I'd like to share a Story Player use-case that I just found:
  https://markm208.github.io/exbook/
  https://markm208.github.io/exbook/chapter1/01/index.html

In simple terms: we want to do that with Web Stories!

Google priorities may be in a different direction.
But, if the "Presentation space" (vs "the Mobile-Story space") is/will be a priority, we'd like to work with you to deliver something like the Animated Introduction to Elixir
While I just stumbled on this site, I've never seen anything quite like it.

Hoping Google has the interest, time and budget to evolve Web Stories deeper into the Presentation/Education space as illustrated by the Elixir Animated Introduction

Am available for discussion on this if appropriate
