Matias, may I ask you a Story implementation issue?
Some of our Stories feature detailed technical content.
Example (using amp-story-player):
https://afdsi.com/amp-story/story-sdl-22-08-12/player.html#
(this example features your TOC overflow advice - many thanks for that)

Here is Story-main:
https://afdsi.com/amp-story/story-sdl-22-08-12/main.html
which enables page-links such as:
https://afdsi.com/amp-story/story-sdl-22-08-12/main.html#page=item-21

OK, that's the background

Here's my question:
  how best to implement a Glossary of Terms in a Story (and Story Player)?

Here is the "ideal":
use amp-story-shopping extension to link a symbol on a page grid to the term definition in an amp-story-attachment

But that's currently not (yet) possible

If we created a specific slide with term defintions (e.g. the last slide in a Story), is there a method to navigate FROM a term (where multiple terms are sprinked on different amp-story-pages) TO the Glossary page (and ideally a #id on that page)?
And can we build a "return to" link for that Glossary item so a reader returns to their last position (the page with the term for which they wanted a definition)?

Or ...
is the a better way to achieve the Glossary concept that you may have implemented but we don't know about?

Many thanks for guidance Matias.
This issue is not urgent so please look at it when convenient for you.
