We would like three extensions to amp-story.
1. Generalization of amp-story-shopping tabs and attachments.
2. Special purpose button to open an amp-sidebar.
3. A Natural Language menu to load an instance of a target NL Story.


Reasoning ...


#1. A generalized extension of amp-story-shopping tabs and attachments would enable a user to see specific information about a tab on a grid.
Example use case: a nutrition fact panel where detail about a term is itemized in a section of an attachment.



#2. An additional outlink-like button to open an amp-sidebar.
Example use case: a glossary of terms used on an amp-page.
The button would limited to an amp-sidebar.



#3. Enables the presentation of a single Story in different NLs.
