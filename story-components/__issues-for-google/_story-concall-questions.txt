we'd like to use amp-story-shopping for non-shopping services.
example: present a food or drug label with buttons at different positions.
when a button is selected, move to a carousel item with a complementary image and a text caption ("detail" about the selected item).
currently several fields enforce specific data types (e.g. price).
can you relax data types for fields, but keep the field's postion in the attachment (i.e. allow us to hijack the field and its position)?




the carousel in an amp-story-attachment for amp-story-shopping is irregular ...
in this example, the carousel works: https://amp.dev/documentation/examples/components/amp-story-shopping/preview/?format=websites ...

but - from desktop - the carousel cannot be selected here: https://wsdemos.uc.r.appspot.com/shopping ...
in our desktop experiment, the horizontal scroll bar is not active ...

out-of-focus items at the left/right edges can be selected, but a user would not clearly see how to do that ...
also - from desktop - when using the cursor to target the carousel, left/right arrow keys advance the slide, not items in the carousel.
