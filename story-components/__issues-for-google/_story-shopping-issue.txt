For shopping:
  https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-story-shopping
would you consider a small change:
  change price and currency fields from mandatory to optional (allowing null values for those fields)

Null values would allow us to generalize "shopping" for different purposes.
We are very keen to link a shopping-selector (for an image) to an item in an attachment carousel.



Very nice.
This will allow us to 'voice over' a presentation (e.g. a sales preso) without the need to have an online presenter.
Is the red bar the voice timeline (showing how much time is left ...)
